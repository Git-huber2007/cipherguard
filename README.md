# CipherGuard

**AI-Powered IPsec VPN Protocol Analyzer and Security Assessment Framework**

Smart India Hackathon 2026 · Problem Statement **SIH26160** · National Technical
Research Organisation (NTRO) · Theme: Blockchain & Cybersecurity

A passive analyzer that audits the cryptographic posture of IPsec VPN
deployments from mirrored traffic alone. It holds no keys, touches no gateway,
and changes no configuration.

---

## The problem, stated precisely

An agency running hundreds of IPsec gateways needs to know which of them are
still negotiating broken cryptography. The conventional answer is to log into
each device and read its configuration, which needs credentials, needs a change
window, and goes stale the moment someone edits a policy.

Reading it off the wire instead runs into a hard structural limit that shapes
this entire design:

| What crosses the wire | Where it lives | Readable passively? |
|---|---|---|
| IKE SA proposal — cipher, PRF, integrity, DH group | `IKE_SA_INIT` (v2), Main/Aggressive Mode (v1) | **Yes**, cleartext |
| Peer identities, vendor IDs, notifies, lifetimes | Same messages | **Yes**, cleartext |
| **Child/ESP SA proposal** — the algorithms actually protecting the data | Inside the encrypted `SK` payload of `IKE_AUTH` (v2), or Quick Mode (v1) | **No** |
| ESP payload | Protocol 50 | **No** |

So the algorithms guarding the IKE control channel are plainly visible, and the
algorithms guarding the actual traffic are not. Prior work sits on one side of
this line or the other: formal configuration verification proves policies
correct on paper but is blind on the wire, and encrypted-traffic classification
reads flow statistics while ignoring handshake structure.

CipherGuard spans it. It parses what is parseable, infers what is not, and is
scrupulous about labelling which is which — every ESP finding is marked
`inferred` and carries a confidence, and no inferred finding is ever presented
as an observation.

---

## How ESP inference works

Not a black box. The dominant signal is arithmetic, straight out of RFC 4303 §2:

```
ESP payload = IV ‖ Enc(data ‖ padding ‖ pad_len ‖ next_hdr) ‖ ICV
```

The encrypted region is padded up to the cipher's block size, and to a 4-byte
boundary at minimum. So for block size `b`, IV length `iv` and ICV length `icv`,
**every** ciphertext length on that SA satisfies

```
len mod max(b,4) == (iv + icv) mod max(b,4)
```

That residue is a fixed fingerprint readable without any key. A second
observable pins it down further: the GCD of gaps between distinct packet
lengths recovers the padding boundary directly, which matters because the
residue test alone is one-directional — a flow padded to 16 bytes automatically
satisfies the 8-byte test, so AES-CBC would otherwise be indistinguishable from
3DES. Entropy supplies the third axis, separating ESP-NULL from real ciphers.

Three components consume those observables:

- **Random Forest** over 88 features — modulo profiles, length statistics,
  entropy, inter-arrival timing.
- **1D-CNN** over the 64-point distribution profile, treating the modulo
  histograms as a periodic signal. Implemented directly in NumPy (~6k
  parameters), so a passive sensor on an isolated segment needs no
  deep-learning runtime.
- **A plausibility mask** applying the framing rules above as hard constraints.
  Suites failing them are zeroed regardless of what the models predict, and each
  exclusion carries a stated reason — which is what makes a finding defensible
  to an auditor rather than a model output to be trusted on faith.

### Validation against real gateways

Every other figure in this project is measured against traffic the project
generated itself, which proves only that it agrees with its own assumptions.

```bash
./scripts/fetch-real-captures.sh
python -m cipherguard.cli verify-real
```

Five real IKE exchanges from the **Wireshark project's test suite** — produced by
real implementations (a Windows IKE stack among them), captured off real
networks. The ground truth is genuinely external: Wireshark names each file
after the algorithm it negotiates (`ikev2-decrypt-aes256gcm16.pcap`), so the
expected result comes from upstream maintainers rather than from anything
written here.

| Capture | Parsed | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `ikev2-decrypt-aes256gcm16.pcap` | AES-GCM-16-256, no INTEG, group 19 | 81/100 |
| `ikev2-decrypt-aes256gcm8.pcap` | AES-GCM-8-256, no INTEG, group 19 | 81/100 |
| `ikev2-decrypt-aes128ccm12.pcap` | AES-CCM-12-128, no INTEG, group 19 | 81/100 |
| `ikev2-decrypt-aes192ctr.pcap` | AES-CTR-192 **with** HMAC-SHA2-512-256 | 81/100 |
| `ikev1-certs.pcap` | IKEv1 3DES/MD5/group 2, Windows, 10 vendor IDs | **18/100** |

**5/5 validated.** The AEAD contrast is the sharpest check: GCM and CCM carry no
INTEG transform, CTR must carry one — confirmed against real implementations
rather than against our own encoder.

#### What the arithmetic alone achieves

Running the RFC 4303 constraints with **no learned model at all**, on the field
corpus:

| | |
|---|---|
| Flows resolved to a single framing class | **92.9%** |
| ...and that class was correct | **92.9%** |
| Wrong answers whenever it resolved | **0** |
| Mean surviving suites | 2.9 of 9 |

The arithmetic never produces a wrong answer — it either resolves a flow or
declines to. The learned models handle the residual 7% and rank within a class,
which is a narrower job than the headline accuracy implies.

#### Calibration

An audit tool that prints "78% confidence" is making a claim, and a finding
carrying a number nobody checked is worse than one carrying none.
**ECE = 0.005** over framing-class confidence:

| Stated confidence | n | Mean stated | Observed accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.8 – 0.9 | 8 | 0.881 | 1.000 |
| 0.9 – 1.0 | 217 | 0.999 | 1.000 |

#### Two bugs this found that synthetic traffic never could

**IKEv1 encryption flag.** Real Main Mode sets the Encryption bit from message
five onward. The payload walker treated the ciphertext as a payload chain and
raised six parse errors against a perfectly valid exchange. The generator only
ever emitted cleartext Main Mode, so no synthetic capture could surface it.

**IKEv1 algorithm names bypassed policy.** The prohibition tables held only
IKEv2 spellings (`ENCR_3DES`), so a real IKEv1 gateway negotiating `3DES_CBC`
never triggered the encryption rule at all. The generator and the policy shared
one vocabulary, so they agreed with each other and both were wrong. That capture
scored 24/100 before the fix and 18/100 after.

Neither was findable without external traffic. That is the argument for this
section existing.

### Cross-model validation: breaking the circularity

Same-model held-out accuracy has a problem worth naming rather than glossing:
the classifier is trained on flows from the RFC framing model and evaluated on
flows from the RFC framing model. Held-out samples control for overfitting to
specific *draws*, not to the *model*. If the generator's assumptions are wrong,
training and test are wrong in identical ways and the evaluation cannot see it.

So there is a second, independent generator (`lab/fieldmodel.py`) built to
disagree — empirical trimodal Internet packet sizes instead of a smooth mixture,
bursty Pareto arrivals instead of exponential, packet loss and reordering,
transport as well as tunnel mode, and TFC padding regimes including pad-to-MTU,
which collapses the length distribution almost flat. What it does *not* vary is
RFC 4303 framing arithmetic, because that is the protocol, not an assumption.

```bash
cipherguard validate
```

| | Same-model | Cross-model |
|---|---|---|
| Framing-class accuracy | 100.0% | **100.0%** |
| Exact-suite accuracy | 59.2% | 54.8% |

Accuracy holds at 100% under 5% packet loss, reordering, transport mode and
pad-to-MTU. But the aggregate hides the finding that matters, which the
ablation exposes:

| Configuration | Framing-class accuracy on field data |
|---|---|
| Learned models alone (mask disabled) | **73.7%** |
| With the RFC 4303 plausibility mask | **100.0%** |

**The machine learning did overfit the generator.** Off-distribution it loses a
quarter of its accuracy, and the deterministic framing constraints are what hold
the result up. Reporting 100% as an ML result would have been a straightforward
misattribution — the honest claim is that a hybrid design survives distribution
shift specifically because half of it is arithmetic that cannot drift.

That is also the engineering argument for the architecture, and it is the answer
to the obvious judging question: what happens on traffic you did not generate.

### Measured accuracy, and its ceiling

Held out, 360 flows the model never saw, through the complete inference path:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| **Framing-class accuracy** | **100.0%** |
| Exact suite accuracy | 59.2% |
| Random Forest alone, no mask | 54.7% |
| 1D-CNN alone, no mask | 50.2% |

The gap between those two top numbers is not a defect to be engineered away —
it is an information-theoretic limit, and reporting only the high number would
misrepresent what the tool knows. **AES-GCM-128, AES-GCM-256, AES-CTR and
ChaCha20-Poly1305 all produce byte-identical ESP framing** (IV 8, ICV 16,
4-byte alignment). Nothing observable distinguishes them, so exact-suite
accuracy is capped near 59% by construction. Likewise DES and 3DES.

What matters operationally is that every member of an indistinguishable group
carries the *same audit verdict*. So the engine reports the class, and a finding
reads:

> Packet framing on this SA matches block 8, IV 8, ICV 12, which identifies
> 3DES-CBC / HMAC-MD5-96 **or** DES-CBC / HMAC-SHA1-96 (framing-identical, not
> separable passively). 64-bit block size is vulnerable to Sweet32…

Both candidates are prohibited, so the verdict is certain even though the label
is not. Cross-class confusion in the held-out evaluation is **zero**.

---

## Beyond point-in-time scanning

Four capabilities separate a continuous assurance system from a scanner. Each
closes a gap the literature survey identified.

### 1. Temporal baseline and downgrade detection

A scanner asks "is this gateway misconfigured?" The more dangerous question is
"did this gateway *become* misconfigured?" — and no single capture can answer it,
because a weak suite in isolation looks like it was always the policy.

CipherGuard keeps a SQLite baseline of the strongest suite ever observed per peer
pair, and flags regression:

```
$ cipherguard watch samples/hardened.pcap --db fleet.db
  new link: 198.51.100.77|203.0.113.55 at 128 bits

$ cipherguard watch samples/downgrade.pcap --db fleet.db
  Cryptographic downgrade detected
    198.51.100.77|203.0.113.55
      was 128 bits (Curve25519, ENCR_AES_GCM_16-256, ESN, PRF_HMAC_SHA2_256)
      now  80 bits (1024-bit MODP, AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96, ENCR_AES_CBC-128, PRF_HMAC_SHA1)
```

That signature — an on-path attacker stripping strong proposals, a failover onto
a legacy standby, a botched firmware rollback — is invisible to a single capture
*and* to configuration review, which sees intended policy rather than what the
peers actually settled on. Exit code 3 makes it a CI/monitoring gate.

### 2. Security strength as a number, not an adjective

An agency with four hundred links needs an ordering, not a list of adjectives.
Every association is scored at its **weakest component**, which is where the
common real-world failure hides: AES-256 with SHA-1 and DH Group 2 reads as
"AES-256" on a configuration screen and is in fact an 80-bit association.

Two figures, because there are two adversaries. Grover halves symmetric key
lengths; **Shor zeroes every classical key exchange outright**, regardless of
modulus. That asymmetry is why key establishment must migrate long before bulk
encryption does, and expressing it numerically makes the argument unarguable.

### 3. Sweet32 quantified from observed throughput

"Don't use 3DES" is advice that loses to an operations team asking why the
outage window is justified. The same finding, computed from this link's actual
measured traffic:

> The negotiated cipher has a 64-bit block, so ciphertext blocks begin colliding
> after roughly 34.4 GB under a single key. With a 48-hour rekey interval this SA
> processes about 1091.79 GB per key, which is **31.775x the bound**. At the
> observed 50.55 Mbps this SA reaches the bound **91 minutes after each rekey**.

Same standard, same cipher — but now it is a change request.

### 4. Harvest-now-decrypt-later exposure and PQC sequencing

"Enable PQC" is not a plan. The quantum threat is *retroactive*, so exposure
depends on traffic volume, key-exchange recoverability, and how long the data
stays sensitive — the last of which the tool cannot observe and takes from the
operator. Mosca's inequality then gives a deadline:

```
$ cipherguard roadmap samples/backbone.pcap --data-class strategic
  Mosca gap +41.0 years: data recorded today will still be sensitive
  when it becomes decryptable.

  1. [idx 10.4] 203.0.113.7 <-> 198.51.100.4
      64 classical / 0 quantum bits · 0.4 MB observed · 50.55 Mbps
```

Phase 1 fixes broken classical crypto (exposed to a conventional attacker
*today*, so the quantum timeline isn't the binding constraint). Phase 2 deploys
RFC 8784 pre-shared keys, which work on existing firmware. Phase 3 enables hybrid
ML-KEM under RFC 9370. The exposure index is a transparent weighted product,
documented in full so a reviewer can disagree with the weights rather than
reverse-engineer them.

### 5. CBOM export — inventory derived from traffic, not source

CycloneDX 1.6 added first-class cryptographic assets because PQC mandates
require organisations to inventory their cryptography. Every existing CBOM
generator derives that inventory from **source code or binaries** — it tells you
what a device is *capable of*. CipherGuard derives it from **observed traffic** —
what a device is *actually doing*.

Those differ constantly in practice. A gateway compiled with AES-GCM support
that negotiates 3DES because of a stale peer policy is invisible to a
source-derived CBOM and obvious here.

```bash
cipherguard cbom samples/backbone.pcap -o fleet-cbom.json
#   CycloneDX 1.6 · 26 cryptographic assets (22 observed, 4 inferred)
#   16 vulnerabilities recorded
```

Every asset carries provenance. Inferred assets additionally carry confidence,
their framing signature, and the full candidate set — an inventory that cannot
distinguish measurement from inference is misleading exactly where it matters
most.

## Audit rules

Findings cite NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1, RFC 8247, RFC 4303, RFC 9395 and
SP 800-131A Rev. 2.

**Observed** (parsed bytes): IKEv1 in use · Aggressive Mode · PSK
authentication · prohibited encryption · prohibited/deprecated integrity and
PRF · weak DH groups · **no quantum-resistant key establishment** · residual
downgrade surface · excessive SA lifetime · negotiation-failure patterns ·
fragmentation not negotiated · **weakest-link security level** ·
**quantified Sweet32 birthday exposure**.

**Inferred** (ESP side-channel): prohibited framing class · payload entropy
below the ciphertext floor · anti-replay discontinuities · insufficient sample.

The downgrade-surface rule is worth calling out: it fires when a gateway still
*advertises* broken transforms even though this session selected a strong one.
Configuration review sees the same list and calls it acceptable; only wire
observation shows what is genuinely reachable.

Post-quantum readiness is treated as a live finding, not a footnote. Any SA
relying purely on classical Diffie-Hellman is flagged for harvest-now-decrypt-later
exposure, with remediation pointing at RFC 8784 pre-shared keys today and
ML-KEM hybrid groups (FIPS 203) as firmware allows.

---

## Reference testbed

`cipherguard lab` writes four scenarios offline — a legacy IKEv1 Aggressive Mode
gateway, a partially modernised IKEv2 gateway, a hardened AES-GCM gateway over
NAT-T, and a mixed backbone with all of them on one mirror port. The IKE packets
are constructed from the RFC field layouts independently of the dissector, so a
misread field surfaces as a round-trip test failure rather than silently
agreeing with itself.

`docker/` additionally runs two real strongSwan gateways on an isolated bridge
with a passive sniffer, for calibration against genuine traffic:

```bash
cd docker && docker compose --profile lab up -d
docker compose exec sniffer /capture.sh weak 60
python -m cipherguard.cli analyze docker/captures/weak.pcap
```

---

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q     # 151 passed (140 + 7 skipped without real captures)
```

Coverage includes pcap round-trips, IPv4 checksum validity, IKEv1/IKEv2
dissection against independently constructed packets, NAT-T marker handling,
graceful degradation on truncated frames, the framing-residue invariant across
every catalogued suite, scoring monotonicity, and policy-table consistency.

Robustness is fuzz-tested rather than assumed: 10,000 mutated IKE messages and
4,000 random payloads, asserting the dissector never raises, never hangs and
never accepts structureless input as a valid reading. Real-world protocol cases
are covered explicitly — RFC 7383 fragmentation, RFC 3948 NAT keepalives (a
single 0xFF byte, sent every 20 seconds by every peer behind NAT), and
retransmission counting so a lossy link does not read as many negotiations.

Also covered: weakest-link scoring, the invariant that **every classical key
exchange has zero quantum strength**, Sweet32 scaling with observed volume,
direction-independent peer identity, baseline retaining the best-ever state
rather than the latest, Mosca sign conventions, and CBOM structural validity
including provenance on every asset.

**Robustness fuzzing** (`tests/test_fuzz.py`) throws 10,000 mutated packets and
4,000 random inputs at the dissector. The contract is absolute: `parse_message`
returns a message or None, records difficulties in `parse_errors`, and never
raises, hangs, or allocates without bound. Its input is chosen by an attacker —
anyone who can put a packet on the monitored segment supplies input to it
directly — and real captures contain malformed packets for innocent reasons too:
snaplen truncation, mid-transfer capture start, hardware offload artefacts.

Real-world protocol handling is covered: RFC 3948 NAT keepalives (a single 0xFF
byte, sent every 20 seconds by every peer behind NAT), RFC 7383 IKE
fragmentation on certificate-bearing exchanges, and retransmission counting so a
lossy path does not read as many distinct negotiations.

Four are explicit regression tests for bugs made during development:

- the plug-in entropy estimator's downward bias, which made correctly encrypted
  AES-GCM tunnels report as unencrypted;
- a label-ordering mismatch between the plausibility mask and the classifier,
  which reported AES-CBC tunnels as 3DES *at 100% confidence* — a wrong answer
  delivered with maximum certainty, the worst failure mode an audit tool has;
- the one-directional modulo constraint that let 3DES shadow AES-CBC;
- linear score deduction flooring every bad capture at zero, erasing the
  difference between bad and catastrophic;
- a hand-assembled BPF filter that branched past the end of the program, which
  the kernel verifier rejected at attach time and which surfaced as total
  capture failure rather than as a filtering problem.

## Deployment: the sensor

Until recently the analyzer could only read files, which meant the "passive
sensor" it describes did not really exist — someone still had to run tcpdump,
move a file, and assess it by hand. Continuous assurance is not a scheduled
batch job.

```bash
cipherguard sensor --check          # capability and interface report
sudo cipherguard sensor eth0 --window 300 --evidence /var/lib/cipherguard/
```

```
Sensor on eth0
  300s windows, continuous  ·  baseline cipherguard-baseline.db
  Receive-only. Ctrl-C to stop.

  [06:47:07] window 1: 18/100 E  1 SA  0 ESP  30 packets
  [06:52:07] window 2: 74/100 C  3 SA  4 ESP  184203 packets
      DOWNGRADE 198.51.100.77|203.0.113.55: 128 -> 80 bits
```

AF_PACKET with no third-party dependency, because the sensor host is expected to
be hardened and minimal, where installing a libpcap binding is a procurement
question rather than a `pip` command. A hand-assembled classic-BPF program does
the IKE/ESP filtering in the kernel — on a backbone carrying mostly non-IPsec
traffic, filtering in userspace would mean copying and discarding every frame.

Two properties matter more than throughput. The socket is **receive-only**: a
monitoring device that can inject onto the segment it monitors is a liability,
and on a defence backbone it is disqualifying. And each window builds and
discards its own state, so memory is bounded by construction. Kernel drop
counts are surfaced per window, because an assessment made from a capture that
silently lost 40% of its packets is not a weaker assessment — it is a
misleading one.

Live capture needs `CAP_NET_RAW`, granted narrowly rather than by running the
analyzer as root:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(readlink -f $(which python3))
```

## Retargeting the policy

An agency's crypto directive will differ from the NIST baseline. Editing module
source to express that forks the tool — every upgrade becomes a merge — and
destroys auditability, because "which policy produced this finding" stops being
answerable from the report.

```bash
cipherguard analyze capture.pcap --policy directive.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "Example national directive",
  "reference": "AGENCY-CRYPTO-DIRECTIVE-2026 s4",
  "MIN_DH_BITS": 3072,
  "MAX_IKE_SA_LIFETIME": 28800,
  "DH_PROHIBITED": { "14": "2048-bit MODP is below the national floor" },
  "ENCR_PROHIBITED": { "ENCR_AES_CBC": "AEAD only under the directive" }

The same capture scores **68 under NIST** and **24 under the stricter
directive**, with no code change. Overlays extend the baseline by default, so
an agency adding a prohibition keeps every NIST prohibition too; wholesale
replacement is opt-in. Unknown keys are rejected loudly — a typo in a policy
file must fail rather than silently leave a check disabled, because a control
that quietly stops running is worse than one that was never configured.

## Deployment: continuous sensor mode

Everything else in the CLI operates on a file somebody already captured by hand,
which is a batch job rather than continuous assurance. `sensor` closes that gap:

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(readlink -f $(which python3))
cipherguard sensor eth1 --window 300 --db fleet.db --audit-log /var/log/cg.jsonl
```

```

    DOWNGRADE 198.51.100.77|203.0.113.55: 128 -> 80 bits
```

Capture is AF_PACKET with a hand-assembled classic-BPF filter, no libpcap
binding — the sensor host is expected to be hardened and minimal, where adding a
native dependency is a procurement question rather than a `pip` command. Kernel
filtering matters on a backbone carrying mostly non-IPsec traffic: userspace
would otherwise copy and discard every frame.

Evidence retention is bounded by default: `--retain 24` windows, `--max-disk-mb
4096` total, and `--max-window-mb 512` on any single window. All three matter.
A duration bound alone still lets one 300-second window reach 7.5 GB on a
200 Mbps link before it returns, and a file-count limit alone cannot bound disk
because window size tracks link load. Use `--no-evidence` to assess and discard
where custody rules do not require keeping the packets.

Two properties are enforced rather than documented. The socket is **receive
only** — a monitoring device that can inject onto the segment it monitors is
disqualifying on a defence backbone. And kernel drop counts are read back and
**reported next to the score**, because an assessment built from a capture that
silently lost 40% of its packets is not a weaker assessment, it is a misleading
one.

## Retargeting the policy

Different authorities disagree legitimately: an agency may mandate a 3072-bit
floor where NIST accepts 2048. That belongs in a reviewable, version-controlled
file rather than a patch carried across upgrades.

```bash
cipherguard analyze capture.pcap --policy agency-directive.json
```

The same capture, same binary:

| Policy | Score | DH Group 14 |
|---|---|---|
| NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1 baseline | 48/100 (D) | accepted |
| Example agency 3072-bit directive | 28/100 (E) | **critical** |

Overlays **extend** the baseline rather than replacing it — an agency adding one
prohibition must not implicitly permit everything the baseline prohibits, since
that failure would be silent and would weaken the audit. Unknown keys are a hard
error: a control that quietly stops running is worse than one that was never
configured.

## Operating it in production

| Concern | Provision |
|---|---|
| API authentication | Opt-in bearer token, compared with `hmac.compare_digest` — a plain `==` returns early on the first differing byte and leaks the prefix to anyone timing responses. `/api/health` stays open so a load balancer can probe it. |
| Custody and accountability | JSON Lines audit trail: who assessed which capture, when, and its SHA-256 — a finding is only meaningful against a known input. Findings are logged as rule ID and subject only, so the trail never becomes a second copy of the intelligence it accounts for. |
| Model provenance | Every model records training time, library versions, corpus and a feature-schema hash. |
| Silent feature drift | Loading refuses if the schema hash differs. This is the failure that matters: array shapes stay compatible, the model loads, and predictions are quietly computed from columns that no longer mean what the model was fitted on. Nothing raises and the output looks plausible. |
| Network exposure | Non-loopback binds refused unless authenticated or explicitly overridden. |
| Resource bounds | Flow-table capacity limits, capture length validation, upload ceilings. |

```bash
CIPHERGUARD_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  cipherguard serve --host 0.0.0.0 --audit-log /var/log/cipherguard.jsonl
```

## Security posture of the analyzer itself

A tool that ingests hostile traffic is itself an attack surface, and a monitoring
system that can be knocked over is worth attacking — blinding the auditor is a
useful precursor to doing something else. Findings from an audit of this
codebase, all fixed and covered by regression tests:

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Unbounded ESP flow table keyed on the attacker-chosen 32-bit SPI | 60k spoofed packets created 60k records and 68 MB. Seconds of line-rate traffic exhausts the sensor. | Capacity cap with least-active eviction, so floods of singletons are dropped before established tunnels. Eviction count is reported so the audit can say its view was incomplete. |
| **That cap then became a CPU denial of service** | Evicting one flow per new key meant every packet of an SPI-randomised flood triggered a full 8192-entry scan — the table never fell below capacity so the scan never stopped. Throughput collapsed **158,000 → 909 pkt/s (175x)**. The memory bound held perfectly while the sensor stopped keeping up with the link: the same attack, moved from RAM to CPU. | Batched `heapq.nsmallest` eviction of the weakest 10%, amortising the scan. Measured back to **178,000 pkt/s**. Guarded by a wall-clock regression test. |
| `joblib.load` on an unsigned pickle | Write access to `models/` was code execution inside the analyzer, often the most privileged process on the sensor. The feature-hash check did not help — it reads `meta.json` from the same directory. | SHA-256 manifest verified **before** the unpickle. Not a signature and does not claim to be; it detects tampering by anything that cannot also rewrite the manifest, and gives operators a hash to pin. |
| One spoofed packet could write a fleet baseline | `negotiated()` fell back to the first *offered* proposal, so an unanswered `IKE_SA_INIT` — which anyone on a mirrored segment can send — permanently set a peer pair's reference point. Set it high and real downgrades never fire; set it low across many pairs and the alert flood trains operators to ignore exit code 3. | Baselines record only responder-confirmed proposals, promote after repeat observation, and rate-limit new peer keys. |
| Capture readers trusted in-file length fields | A 140-byte file declaring a 3 GB packet is a 20-million-fold memory amplification. | Every length validated against a snaplen ceiling *and* the bytes actually remaining in the file. |
| Baseline DB path accepted as an API query parameter | The store opens the path as SQLite and creates parent directories: unauthenticated arbitrary-directory creation and file probing. | Path is fixed at application construction; the endpoint takes no parameters. |
| Capture filename interpolated into generated router config | A name containing a newline ends the comment, and the remainder becomes a live configuration directive an operator pastes into a gateway. | All untrusted text flattened and length-bounded before it enters generated config. |
| Upload endpoint unbounded, overwriting, path-rewriting | Disk exhaustion; silent destruction of evidence a prior assessment relied on. | 512 MB cap with partial-file cleanup, 409 on existing names, explicit rejection of path-bearing names rather than silent `basename()` rewriting. |
| Dashboard unauthenticated on any bind address | Publishes a map of which national links are cryptographically weak — exactly the targeting information an attacker wants. | Non-loopback binds refused unless explicitly overridden. |

Authentication and audit logging are implemented (`require_token` with
`hmac.compare_digest` on every route except `/api/health` and `/static`, plus
`core/audit_log.py`). Both are opt-in, and the loopback-only default is what
makes that safe by construction rather than by documentation. What is still
missing is TLS termination and per-user identity — the API is designed to sit
behind an authenticating reverse proxy for those.

## Limitations

Stated plainly, because an audit tool that overstates its own certainty is worse
than none.

- **Exact ESP suite identification is impossible for framing-identical suites.**
  The tool reports the class and names the candidates.
- **Payload content is never recoverable.** No keys, no decryption, by design.
- **Inference needs volume.** Under ~60 packets the length distribution is not
  stable and findings are marked provisional.
- **Throughput is measured, not claimed.** On a 146 MB capture, single-threaded:
  **115,000 packets/sec** for the full pipeline and **235,000 packets/sec** for
  the reader alone. That is the portable pure-Python path; the DPDK/C++
  ingestion path described in the proposal is a separate component and is not in
  this repository, so no line-rate claim is made.
- **Live capture is Linux-only** and needs `CAP_NET_RAW`. It degrades with an
  explanation rather than a traceback elsewhere.
- **The IKE dissector is now validated against five real captures**, but the
  **ESP inference model has still never seen a real tunnel.** The public corpus
  contains IKE handshakes, not sustained ESP traffic, so framing inference
  remains validated only across generators.
- **The shipped model has never seen traffic from a real gateway.** Cross-model
  validation against an independent generator substantially raises confidence
  that it keys on protocol structure rather than generator artefacts, and it is
  not the same thing as field validation. Run the Docker testbed and retrain
  before operational use. This remains the single largest gap in the project.
- **Vendor fingerprinting is best-effort.** Many gateways suppress vendor IDs;
  remediation then defaults to strongSwan syntax.

## Legal and privacy posture

Mirroring production traffic carries custody, retention and privacy
obligations. CipherGuard is built to minimise that exposure: it retains flow
metadata only — lengths, sequence numbers, timings, entropy statistics — and
never writes payload bytes to disk or logs. It is passive throughout; there is
no code path that transmits to a gateway or applies generated configuration.
Deploy on mirror ports under the same authorisation that governs any other
lawful interception of the segment.
