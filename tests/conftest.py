"""Shared test fixtures.

The ESP rules can only fire when an inference model exists, so tests that
exercise them depend on one. Relying on a `models/` directory left behind by a
previous run makes the suite pass or fail according to the state of the working
tree, which hides exactly the kind of regression the suite is there to catch —
a clean checkout would have skipped the ESP path entirely and still reported
green. So the suite trains its own model, once, into a temporary directory.

It is deliberately small: enough samples and epochs for the framing signal to
be learned reliably, not enough to make the suite slow.
