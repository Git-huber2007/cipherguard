"""Validation against real captures, skipped when they are not present.

These tests are the answer to the sharpest question this project faces: every
other accuracy figure is measured against traffic the project generated itself,
which proves only that it agrees with its own assumptions.

The captures are not vendored — they belong to the Wireshark project — so these
tests skip cleanly on an offline checkout. Run `scripts/fetch-real-captures.sh`
to enable them.
