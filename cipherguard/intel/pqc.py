"""Harvest-now-decrypt-later exposure and PQC migration sequencing.

"Enable post-quantum crypto" is not a plan. An agency with hundreds of links,
a fixed engineering budget and vendors at different firmware levels needs to
know which link to migrate first — and the honest answer is not simply the one
with the weakest cipher.

The distinguishing feature of the quantum threat is that it is retroactive.
Traffic recorded today is decrypted later, so exposure depends on three things
a passive analyzer can actually measure or be told:

  volume       how much traffic crosses the link, which is how much an
               adversary can harvest per unit time
  key exchange whether the session key is recoverable by Shor at all, which for
               every classical DH group is simply yes
  secrecy life how long the data stays sensitive, which is the one input the
               tool cannot observe and must take from the operator

Mosca's inequality frames the deadline: if the time data must stay secret plus
the time needed to migrate exceeds the time until a capable quantum computer
exists, you are already late. This module makes that arithmetic explicit per
link rather than leaving it as a slogan.

The exposure index is a transparent weighted product, not a learned or
calibrated risk score. It is stated here in full so a reviewer can disagree with
the weights rather than having to reverse-engineer them.
