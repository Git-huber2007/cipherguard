"""Live capture from a network interface.

Until now the analyzer could only read files, which meant the "passive sensor"
it describes did not exist: someone still had to run tcpdump, move a file, and
run an assessment by hand. Continuous assurance is not a scheduled batch job.

This is AF_PACKET on Linux with no third-party dependency, because the sensor
host is expected to be a hardened, minimal, possibly air-gapped machine where
installing a libpcap binding is a procurement question rather than a pip
command. The same `decode()` used for capture files handles the frames, so
there is exactly one packet-decoding path and live traffic cannot diverge from
file behaviour.

Two properties matter more than throughput:

  It is receive-only. The socket is never bound for transmission and nothing in
  this module writes to it. A monitoring device that can inject onto the
  segment it monitors is a liability, and on a defence backbone it is
  disqualifying.

  It cannot grow without bound. A capture loop with no ceiling on time, packets
  or bytes turns a busy link into an outage on the sensor.
