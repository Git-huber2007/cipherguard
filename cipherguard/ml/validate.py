"""Cross-model validation.

Trains on the RFC framing model and evaluates on the independent field model,
then breaks the result down by traffic condition. The per-condition breakdown is
the point: an aggregate number hides which assumption the classifier is actually
leaning on, and a failure confined to one regime is a finding rather than noise.

The comparison to keep in mind while reading the output is that same-model
held-out accuracy is an upper bound. Any gap between it and the cross-model
figure is the portion of performance that came from generator artefacts rather
than from protocol structure.
