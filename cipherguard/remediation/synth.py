"""Remediation synthesis.

Turns findings into a drop-in hardening configuration for the platform the
vendor-ID fingerprint identified. Output is deliberately conservative:

  * It is emitted as a reviewable script, never applied. The analyzer is passive
    by design and holds no credentials on any gateway.
  * New policy is added under fresh names and priorities rather than editing
    existing entries in place, so an operator can stage it and cut over during a
    change window instead of dropping live tunnels.
  * Every block cites the finding that motivated it, so a change-approval board
    can trace each line back to a specific observation.
