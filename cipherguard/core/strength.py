"""Quantified security strength.

Findings that say "weak" are not actionable at fleet scale. An agency with four
hundred gateways needs an ordering: which link do we fix first, and why that one.
That requires putting a number on each negotiated suite.

Two numbers, because there are two adversaries:

  classical_bits  work factor for a conventional attacker, in bits
  quantum_bits    work factor once a cryptanalytically relevant quantum
                  computer exists

Grover's algorithm halves the effective key length of a symmetric cipher, so
AES-256 drops to 128 and AES-128 to 64. Shor's algorithm breaks finite-field and
elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman outright, so every classical key exchange in use
today has a quantum strength of zero regardless of modulus size. That asymmetry
is the whole reason the post-quantum migration is urgent for key establishment
long before it is urgent for bulk encryption, and expressing it numerically is
what turns "enable PQC eventually" into a ranked work queue.

Figures follow NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5 Table 2 for classical strength.
