    The bound is a security control, not tidiness. A passive sensor ingests
    whatever an attacker chooses to put on the monitored segment, and the SPI is
    a 32-bit attacker-chosen field that keys this table. Without a cap, spoofing
    ESP packets with randomised SPIs creates one flow record per packet — 60k
    packets produced 60k records and 68 MB in testing, so a few seconds of
    line-rate traffic exhausts the sensor. Taking down the monitoring is a
    worthwhile attack in itself: it blinds the auditor before doing something
    else.

    Once at capacity, the tracker evicts the least active flow rather than
    refusing new ones, so a flood cannot pin out the genuine long-lived tunnels
    that matter, and it records that eviction happened so the report can say the
    view was incomplete instead of quietly under-reporting.

        key, so every packet triggered a full linear scan of 8192 entries: the
        table never dropped below capacity, and throughput collapsed from
        ~158,000 packets/second to ~900. The memory bound held perfectly while
        the sensor stopped keeping up with the link — the same denial of service
        the cap was added to prevent, moved from RAM to CPU.

        Evicting a batch amortises the scan over many insertions, so a flood
        costs one pass per `evict_batch` new keys rather than one per packet.
        Least-active-first still holds, so flood singletons go before
