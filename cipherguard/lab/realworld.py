"""Validation against real captures from a public corpus.

Every accuracy figure elsewhere in this project is measured against traffic the
project itself generated. That is a real limit, and it is the one a reviewer
should press hardest on: a dissector validated only against its own generator
has proven that it agrees with itself.

These captures come from the Wireshark project's test suite — real IKE
exchanges produced by real implementations (a Windows IKE stack, a strongSwan
peer), captured off a real network, with all the untidiness that implies:
vendor IDs this project has never seen, Microsoft-specific NAT-T drafts,
certificate payloads, retransmissions, and Main Mode messages whose later
exchanges are encrypted.

The ground truth is genuinely external. Wireshark names each file after the
algorithm it negotiates — `ikev2-decrypt-aes256gcm16.pcap` — so the expected
result comes from the Wireshark maintainers rather than from anything written
here. Asserting against a label somebody else chose is what makes this a test
rather than a restatement.

The captures are not redistributed in this repository. Run
`scripts/fetch-real-captures.sh` to download them; the tests skip cleanly when
they are absent so an offline checkout still passes.
