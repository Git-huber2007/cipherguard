"""An independent traffic model, built to disagree with the training model.

The accuracy figures reported by `ml/train.py` have a circularity problem that
has to be named rather than glossed: the classifier is trained on flows from
`ml/synth.py` and evaluated on flows from `ml/synth.py`. Held-out samples control
for overfitting to specific *draws*, but not for overfitting to the *model*. If
the generator's assumptions are wrong, both the training and the test set are
wrong in exactly the same way, and the evaluation cannot detect it.

This module is the control. It generates ESP flows under assumptions chosen to
differ from the training generator wherever the truth is genuinely uncertain:

  training model (ml/synth.py)          field model (this file)
  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------
  three-mode uniform inner sizes        empirical trimodal Internet size
                                        distribution, with the 40-64B ACK
                                        spike and 1500B MTU mode
  exponential inter-arrivals            bursty ON/OFF, Pareto-distributed
                                        burst lengths
  no packet loss or reordering          loss and reordering on the capture
  tunnel mode only                      tunnel and transport mode
  TFC padding rarely, uniform           TFC padding regimes including
                                        pad-to-MTU, which collapses the
                                        length distribution almost flat
  one SA per flow                       mid-flow rekeys
  clean capture                         snaplen truncation

What is *not* varied is the framing arithmetic of RFC 4303 §2. That is not an
assumption, it is the protocol: the IV, the pad-to-blocksize, the trailer and
the ICV are mandatory and their lengths are fixed by the suite. A generator that
varied those would not be modelling IPsec.

So this is cross-model validation, not field validation. It substantially raises
confidence that the classifier keys on protocol structure rather than on
generator artefacts, and it does not replace a capture from a real gateway.
Retaining that distinction matters more than the number it produces.
