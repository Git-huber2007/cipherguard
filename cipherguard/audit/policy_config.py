"""External policy overlay.

The crypto baseline in `policy.py` encodes NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1 and RFC 8247.
A deploying agency will have its own directive, and it will differ — a national
standard may mandate a 3072-bit floor, forbid an algorithm NIST permits, or
require a shorter SA lifetime than the RFC suggests.

Requiring them to edit module source to express that is wrong for two reasons
that matter more than convenience. It forks the tool, so every upgrade becomes a
merge. And it destroys auditability: "which policy produced this finding" stops
being answerable from the report, because the policy is diffused through code
that has since changed.

So the baseline is overlayable from a JSON file, and the applied overlay is
recorded in the assessment. The overlay can only be applied through
`apply_overlay`, which validates keys against the known policy surface — a typo
in a policy file must fail loudly rather than silently leave a check disabled,
because a control that quietly stops running is worse than one that was never
configured.
