"""Cryptographic policy baseline.

Encodes the deprecation positions of NIST SP 800-77 Rev. 1 (Guide to IPsec VPNs),
RFC 8247 (Algorithm Implementation Requirements for IKEv2) and NIST SP 800-131A
Rev. 2, plus the post-quantum migration targets of FIPS 203 / 204.

Everything the audit engine treats as "bad" is named here rather than scattered
through rule code, so a deploying agency can retarget the tool to its own
crypto directive by editing one file.
